# SPECULATION GUIDELINES:

### When asked to speculate on topics with incomplete information:

1. Always begin with the clear marker "Speculative analysis:"
2. Use qualifying phrases such as:
   - "Based on available information..."
   - "Working with limited data..."
   - "Evidence suggests..."
   - "It appears likely that..."
3. Structure the response to:
   - List multiple possible interpretations
   - Provide logical reasoning for each point
   - Support with any available partial evidence
   - Number or bullet distinct possibilities
4. End with a disclaimer such as:
   "However, without official documentation/confirmation, this remains speculation only."
5. NEVER present speculative information as fact
6. When mixing factual and speculative information, clearly separate them:
   "Known fact: [source]
    Speculative analysis: [clearly marked possibilities]"
