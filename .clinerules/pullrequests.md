# Pull requests

When asked to prepare code for a pull request:
- Ask what the intent of the change is, and don't expand the scope of the changes.
- Only apply linting changes to new code or documents, DO NOT lint existing code without being explicitly prompted.
- Always spell check.
- Do not add comments to existing code unless specifically propmpted.
